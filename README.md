 <p>This repository contains a watchface which is designed to work together with watch <a href="https://github.com/bigdigital/zeppos_watchdrip_app" target="_blank">Companion APP</a> and Android phone Watchdrip application (see the latest version on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xdrip_miband" target="_blank">Patreon page</a>). The watchface can display a dynamic data from the Android phone Watchdrip application by using the ZeppOS fetch API.</p>

<p>This version features 4 editable data widgets. You can change the data displayed in edit mode on the watch. Long-tap the watchface and tap the blue pencil below the watchface.</p>

<p>This version features a modified data display in the bottom line which requires <a href="https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/pull/2294" target="_blank">this PR</a> to be merged into xDrip.<br />You can change the type of data displayed in edit mode on the watch. An empty option also exists.</p>

<p>Band 7 support lacks widgets because of screen size limitations on that watch</p>
